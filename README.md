# Yahtzee
Yahtzee is a dice game involving five dice. After the dice are rolled, the player can earn a score for various combinations of dice. This program will determine scores for some of these combinations.

When you run the program, you will be asked to hit enter to roll the dice the first time. The dice will be shown, followed by a listing of scores that the current dice configuration would earn. Next, you can select the dice you would like to roll again by entering their values at the prompt. If you hit enter, the program will end. The program will also end after the third roll.
