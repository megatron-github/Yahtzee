# Yahtzee

Yahtzee is a dice game involving five dice. After each roll of dice, the player can earn a score for various combinations of dice. The program will determine scores for some of these combinations. When you run the program, the program will ask you to hit enter to roll the dice the first time. It will show the faces of the dice after each roll, followed by a listing of scores that the current dice configuration would earn. Next, you can select the dice you would like to roll again by entering their values at the prompt. If you hit enter, the program will end. The program will also end after the third roll.
